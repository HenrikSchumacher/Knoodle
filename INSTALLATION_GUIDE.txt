KNOODLE INSTALLATION GUIDE
===========================

QUICK INSTALLATION (for users who already have the tap)
--------------------------------------------------------
# Install git-lfs first (required)
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

# Install knoodle
brew install knoodle


FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION (for new users)
----------------------------------------
# 1. Add the tap
brew tap designbynumbers/cantarellalab

# 2. Install git-lfs (required for repository cloning)
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

# 3. Install knoodle
brew install knoodle


ONE-LINER INSTALLATION
----------------------
brew tap designbynumbers/cantarellalab && brew install git-lfs && git lfs install && brew install knoodle


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
* Git LFS is required because Knoodle uses it to store large binary files
* On Linux, this may take 20-30 minutes as it recompiles dependencies with 
  LLVM/clang for ABI compatibility
* The installation compiles from source for optimal performance on your CPU


WHY GIT LFS IS REQUIRED
-----------------------
Knoodle uses Git LFS to store large binary files efficiently. The installation 
will fail with a clear error message if git-lfs is not installed first.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Error: "git-lfs: command not found"
→ This means git-lfs is not installed. Follow the installation steps above.

Error: Formula not found  
→ Make sure you've added the tap: brew tap designbynumbers/cantarellalab

Build taking a long time on Linux
→ This is normal! The formula recompiles dependencies with LLVM for best 
  compatibility. Grab a coffee and wait for it to finish.


WHAT GETS INSTALLED
-------------------
* polyfold: Knot-tightening tool
* knoodletool: Knot theory utilities  
* Headers: Development headers in $(brew --prefix)/include/knoodle/


VERIFICATION
------------
Test the installation:
polyfold --help
knoodletool --help


PERFORMANCE NOTES
-----------------
* Both tools are compiled with CPU-specific optimizations (-march=native)
* On macOS: Uses clang with matrix extensions for maximum performance
* On Linux: Uses Homebrew LLVM/clang for ABI safety and performance
* Performance should be comparable between platforms
